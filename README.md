## Known issues:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that this manifest has been empirically created from data from _my_ PSP and _my_ saves.
> Therefore, some entries could be missing.
> 
> For instance, if a game allows to save to three slots and I only ever used the first two ones, the
> slot 3 will be missing from the manifest since it's not present on my PSP.
>
> If you notice such missing entries, feel free to open a pull request.
